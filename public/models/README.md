# Face-API.js Models

This directory should contain the following face-api.js model files:

- tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
- tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
- face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_landmark_68_model-shard1
- face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_recognition_model-shard1
- face_recognition_model-shard2

These files need to be downloaded from the face-api.js GitHub repository:
https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights

Place all these files directly in this directory (not in subdirectories) for the face authentication system to work properly.
